# Next Apple Health types — plan, not a build

Recorded **10 Sep 2026** after Marc asked which Health stats most people actually have, and whether “Activity” should be next. Collection of the agreed movement types started the same day. Production scoring stays **Steps**. Do **not** publish a new fight option until Marc picks one after looking at the stored data.

WHOOP and Strava stay later.

Related: [`sports-health-integrations.md`](sports-health-integrations.md), [`fight-rules.md`](../fight-rules.md), [`system-design.md`](../system-design.md) §7 and §9.

## The short answer

“Activity” is the right instinct. The type to pull is **Active Energy** (Move calories), not the Exercise or Stand rings.

Marc chose collect-first on 10 Sep 2026: ask Health for the agreed movement types, store them privately, and publish a fight option later. Extra types still mean a new permission sheet and honest privacy copy. Do not show those types on New until the stored data looks usable.

## What most people actually have

Apple does not publish a public “percent of users with this type on.” Coverage here is from how the iPhone and Watch write Health, plus what WHOOP / Garmin / Strava already export.

| What people say | HealthKit type | Who has real numbers | Fight-ready now? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Steps | `stepCount` | Almost every iPhone. The phone writes this itself. | **Already shipping.** |
| Distance | `distanceWalkingRunning` | Same sensor as Steps. Nearly everyone who has Steps. | High coverage, **low new game** — it is Steps in metres. |
| Flights | `flightsClimbed` | Most iPhones with a barometer. | Type is common; many days are **0**. Weak fight. |
| Activity / Move | `activeEnergyBurned` | Apple Watch: this **is** the red Move ring. WHOOP, Garmin, Strava, Oura write it when the user turns that Health export on. Phone-only: some estimated calories, often thin. | **Best next Measure.** Same cumulative query as Steps. |
| Exercise minutes | `appleExerciseTime` | **Watch only.** Phone-only friends show 0. | Skip. This was the old “Active Minutes” mock. |
| Stand | `appleStandHour` / `appleStandTime` | **Watch only.** | Skip. |
| Workouts | `HKWorkout` | Only people who record a session (Watch, Fitness+, Strava, …). Casual step-fighters often have few or none. | Second wave. Needs the workout rules in `fight-rules.md`. |
| Heart rate, HRV, sleep, weight | matching quantity / category types | Watch, band, or scale. | Different product. Heavier privacy. Not a first extra fight. |

The three Fitness rings (Move / Exercise / Stand) are **Watch-first**. Phone-only users do not get a fair Exercise or Stand fight. Move calories still reach more people than those two rings because wearables write Active Energy into Health even without a Watch workout.

Do **not** score fights from `HKActivitySummary`. That API is calendar-day Activity rings, not an exact Fight window. Keep the Steps pattern: Apple’s merged cumulative statistic over `starts_at` → `cutoff_at`, plus daily buckets for the chart only.

Some regions give phone-only users **Move Time** (`appleMoveTime`) instead of Move calories. If we ship Active Energy only, those people look empty. Decide that in the metric spec before coding.

## Recommendation

**Next pull: Active Energy. One new Measure. Same ingest shape as Steps.**

Why this one, not Distance or Exercise Minutes:

1. It is what people mean by Activity / Move.
2. Watch + WHOOP + Garmin + Strava + Oura already land here in Health. Direct vendor APIs stay later.
3. It is a different game from Steps (effort, not step volume). Distance is not.
4. The phone code is almost the same: another `HKStatisticsQuery` / collection query, another permission type, another unit (`kcal`).
5. Exercise Minutes and Stand would zero out friends who only have an iPhone.

Name it **Active Energy** or **Move** in the product. Do not reuse the old **Active Minutes** label unless we later mean Exercise Minutes on purpose.

## What we will not do in this wave

- Do not request ten Health types “just in case.”
- Do not store raw samples, per-source totals, routes, heart rate, or sleep.
- Do not turn on WHOOP or Strava OAuth. If those apps write Active Energy to Health, the Apple Health path already sees it.
- Do not restore the old New-screen metric picker as decoration. A second Measure is real or it stays hidden.
- Do not invent the Advanced fight-rule form.

## Collecting now (10 Sep 2026)

The phone asks Health for the agreed movement types. Users can check or uncheck each one. The same Steps sync request may send private daily totals and workout summaries. Those rows live in `private.healthkit_activity_days` and `private.healthkit_workouts`. They do not change standings, charts, or New.

## Plan when Marc publishes a fight type

### 1. Lock the Measure

Write a one-page metric spec before any Swift:

- Type: `activeEnergyBurned`
- Unit: kilocalories
- Score: total over the exact Fight window (same as Steps)
- Source: Apple’s merged HealthKit aggregate, labelled **Apple Health**
- Empty / denied reads: same honesty rule as Steps — HealthKit will not tell us “permission denied”
- Phone-only and Move Time: in or out
- Manual / user-entered energy: in or out
- Privacy strings: update `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` to name Steps **and** Active Energy

Existing users who already granted Steps will see a **second** Health permission sheet. Ask only when the new Measure ships, not earlier.

### 2. Ingest like Steps

Reuse the current aggregate path. Do not invent a warehouse.

- Phone: request `stepCount` + `activeEnergyBurned` when the user connects Health
- Phone: for each active/ending Fight window, send the merged total for **that Fight’s Measure only**
- Phone: send merged daily buckets only for chart days of those fights
- Backend: same snapshot / `metric_days` seam; metric is no longer hardcoded to `steps`
- Background delivery: observe the types we actually score
- You → Apple Health: show today’s Steps and, once connected, today’s Active Energy
- Account deletion: delete the new aggregates the same way as Steps

Create stays **Steps × highest** until step 3 is ready. Collecting energy with no fight that uses it is the warehouse we are avoiding.

### 3. One new fight type

After ingest is real on two phones:

- New: **Steps** or **Active Energy**, still highest total, same durations
- A Fight locks its Measure at start. Do not mix Steps and Energy on one card
- Standings, gap, chart, finalization copy the Steps path with a different unit
- Changelog + TestFlight when people can see it

### 4. After that works

- **Workouts** (`HKWorkout`): “did you train.” Needs minimum minutes, manual workouts, overlaps. That is Workout Count.
- Exercise Minutes / Stand: only if we accept Watch-only fights
- Distance: only if someone wants a running-specific fight; it is not the next general metric
- Direct WHOOP / Strava: only for scores Health cannot see (Recovery, Strain, Readiness). Ordinary energy and workouts stay on Health
- FitFight recorder / Watch app: no, unless the product becomes a live session. Apple already converts sensors into sports numbers. Users record in Apple Workout, Strava, or Runna; we read Health. [`recording-vs-apple-health.md`](recording-vs-apple-health.md)

## Decision for Marc

Pick one:

1. **Active Energy next** — Watch and wearable friends get a second fight. Phone-only friends may look thin. Recommended.
2. **Stay Steps-only** until the current two-phone Steps fight is proven and App Store is closer.
3. **Distance next** — almost everyone has it, but it is the same race as Steps.

Do not pick “pull everything now.”
