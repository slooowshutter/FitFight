# FitFight status — what works, what’s fake, what’s next

Read this before building. Last updated **4 Sep 2026**. App: **1.0.0**.

Do **not** restore removed surfaces. Do **not** build WHOOP, Strava, Active Minutes, Workout Count, payments, notifications, social, or a broader marketing site unless [`backlog.md`](backlog.md) says so. Only the public privacy and support pages exist on the web.

## GitHub vs Supabase (the two pairs)

There are two **git** branches and two **hosted databases**. They line up.

| | Testing | Real users / App Store |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | `develop` | `main` |
| TestFlight | any push that is **not** `main`, plus the daily scheduled `develop` build | never; `main` does not upload to TestFlight |
| Supabase | develop project (`zstzbf…`, version line says `staging`) | production (`pvqn…`, version line says `prod`) |
| What you do | Merge PRs **into `develop`**. Try the app. | Merge `develop` → `main` only when Marc says ship |

A feature PR is a third git branch. Merge it **into `develop`**. That updates the **staging** database (new SQL) and is the home for later chats.

Once configured, Vercel accepts small authenticated Apple Health aggregate requests and receives account-deletion commands. The phone sends Apple's merged Steps total for each exact Fight window, plus merged daily buckets only for the relevant Fight chart days. Create, join, and leave go through the API. Opening the app closes a fight whose days are up. Standings are a comparison of rows already in the database.

You still do **not** paste `sb_secret_...` anywhere.

## Before this branch ships

Apple Health synchronization requires `FITFIGHT_API_URL=https://staging.fitfight.app` plus Vercel's server-only Supabase URL/secret and pooled `DATABASE_URL`. Fresh Apple sign-in and automatic revocation also require the Vercel Sign in with Apple Team/key/private-key/client-ID values and stable token-encryption key. Configure those first; otherwise sign-in fails visibly. Do not expose schema `private`.

After the backend is configured, merge the feature PR into **`develop`**, not `main`. The staging migration must land before testing the new TestFlight build.

Verify the minimal product alongside Apple Health synchronization:

1. TestFlight → **Update**. Look for `1.0.0 · build N · staging · 4 Sep` at the top.
2. Check Fights, a Fight detail, New, and You in both Night and Day. There are only three tabs: Fights, New, You.
3. New starts on Create or Join. Create still guides Steps, duration, invite-only or joinable, optional usernames, optional repeat, the required action, and review. Join is a 4-character code plus a live joinable list with no scores. Earlier create steps use **Next**. Review uses **Slide to start**.
4. Confirm sign-in, username, Apple Health Steps, Fight invitations, standings with last-sync times, Privacy, Support, Bugs & requests, Versions, sign out, and Delete account.
5. Confirm the old Requests tab, friend requests/lists, money, other Metrics, and dead settings are absent.
6. If sign-in fails: hosted **develop** Supabase → Authentication → Providers → Apple → On, client ID `com.fitfight.mvp`.

The native Fight path uses the API to create and join; Apple Health synchronization and account deletion also require Vercel.

## What this build does

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| Welcome + Apple sign-in | Works |
| Languages | English and French follow the iPhone's per-app language. Usernames, Fight names, and loser actions remain exactly as entered. |
| Username onboarding | Works. Required once after sign-in. |
| Version line | Release-candidate TestFlight says `1.0.0 · build N · staging`; the App Store build says `prod` |
| Create Steps challenge | Follow a guided flow: Create or Join, then Steps × highest total, 3 / 7 / 14 / 30 days, invite-only usernames or a joinable code, optional recurring, required loser action, and review. Joinable fights may start with the owner alone. |
| Accept / Join | Invites still accept in the fight. Joinable fights open the same Accept/Join screen from a code, the live list, or a shared link. Joins go through the server. Leave a joinable or repeating fight from the fight itself so the next window does not copy you in. |
| Invite participants | Exact username in New for invite-only fights. Joinable fights use a 4-character code and a live list instead. They must have signed in and chosen a username. There is no friendship or friend-request layer. |
| Apple Health | Installs background delivery at launch, keeps one interrupted opportunity for foreground reconciliation, and shows private capability/sync status under You. It sends Apple's merged cumulative Steps total for each exact active/ending Fight window in one small authenticated request. It does not send raw samples, deletions, per-source totals, device/source metadata, anchors, or archives. |
| Daily totals | Sends Apple's merged daily buckets only for days relevant to active Fight charts. They are display data, not the source of the Fight score. |
| Fights list | Every row is titled by the loser action, because a Fight is created with the fixed name `Steps Fight` and New never asks for one. The right-hand number is your gap to the person you are racing, moss when ahead and ember when behind; the days left sit under the action. There is no moss hero — live Fights are all the same size. |
| Standings | Live scoring uses exact Fight-window HealthKit aggregates, not overlapping whole-day totals. Both phones read the same serving rows. Each standing shows relative sync freshness; ended Fights distinguish exact final-window coverage from the last available Steps. |
| Fight end | Exact `ends_at` is the final cutoff. Opening the app closes due fights; the protected Vercel cron runs daily if nobody opens it. After finalization, later Steps and scoring-code changes cannot change the stored result. |
| Tabs | Fights, New, You. The old Requests tab and Design are removed. |
| Look | Night/Day, Nunito, fixed Moss/Ember/Gold semantics; no accent picker or public design-system showcase. |
| Versions | Works under You → Settings; the version label stays at the top of every root screen. Staging TestFlight also shows an opaque notice under that line when a newer build has been uploaded. |
| Bugs & requests | Works under You → Settings. Signed-in people can post a bug or a feature request, browse the board, upvote, and comment with their username. |
| Privacy / Support | Pages are implemented and linked under You → Settings. Staging uses `staging.fitfight.app`; production uses `fitfight.app`. Each route must be deployed before that build is tested or submitted. |
| Account deletion | Permanently deletes the profile, username, authentication, Health/Steps data, relationships, invitations, memberships, scores, owned Fights, and bugs/requests the User posted; removes participation from other Fights; clears local Health sync state; and revokes a stored Apple credential when available. |
| WHOOP / Strava | Not built |
| Removed scope | No persistent friends, Requests tab, money/payouts, bragging-rights option, other Metrics, goals, custom dates, or dead settings/actions. |

## Honest limits

- The server accepts a signed-in User's device upload as their own activity. Fine for two friends; not anti-cheat yet.
- FitFight trusts Apple's current merged aggregate from the signed-in User's device. It does not retain the underlying raw samples or source/device provenance, so this is not an anti-cheat or audit trail.
- Apple may revise its merged total after a Watch sync, edit, or deletion. Live snapshots can change until the Fight is `final` and member `finalized_at` is set; completed civil days keep their stored chart total. Chart buckets never overwrite the exact-window score.
- Same Apple ID on production vs staging is **two** accounts.
- `web/` owns Apple Health aggregate ingestion and account deletion. There are no app-facing Postgres RPCs.

## Next product work

Urgent freeze is in this PR. Marc still needs to tap Delete account once on staging. Two-phone Steps proof (invite, matching standings, fight close) is still worth doing if it has not been proven.
