          FitFight lets named participants compete on who records the most Steps during
          a private Fight. This policy explains the data used by the FitFight iPhone app
          and its support website.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Data we collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Account data:</strong> your Sign in with Apple identifier, email
              address (which may be an Apple private relay address), name when Apple
              supplies it, the FitFight username you choose, and an encrypted server-only
              Apple credential used to disconnect Sign in with Apple when you delete your
              account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Referrals:</strong> a random sharing code and the accounts of the
              person referring and the person referred, with the time the referral was
              recorded. We use this to understand who brings friends to FitFight. These
              relationships stay private and are removed when either account is deleted.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fight data:</strong> the usernames invited to a Fight, its title,
              action and duration, membership status, aggregate scores, rank, and timestamps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Apple Health:</strong> with your permission, FitFight reads Step
              Count and other movement types (active and resting energy, distance, exercise,
              stand, flights, and workouts). Steps fights still send the merged step total
              for each exact Fight window plus the relevant daily step totals used by Fight
              charts. Other activity totals stay on your account and are not shown to other
              participants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Posts, photos, and feedback:</strong> text, selected photos, videos,
              files, comments, reactions, and tags you submit. Feed posts are visible to
              the audience selected in the composer; bugs and feature requests are
              visible to other signed-in users with your username. Your profile also
              stores your chosen companion and any custom description. We store reports
              and blocks to moderate user content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Notifications:</strong> your device push token, notification
              preferences, language, time zone, and delivery records, used to send the
              optional notifications you enable.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Support and operations:</strong> messages you send to support and
              limited server logs such as request time, IP address, device or browser
              information, and error details needed to keep the service secure and working.
              Private sync diagnostics also record how long Apple Health reads and network
              requests take, their success or failure, app version, and request sizes.
              These timing records contain no Steps values or raw Health samples and are
              not shared with other participants.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Apple Health</h2>
          <p>
            Apple Health access is read-only. FitFight does not write to Apple Health.
            The current app does not send raw Health samples, GPS routes, heart rate, or
            device and source metadata. It may send merged daily activity totals and
            workout summaries (identifier, type, time, duration, optional active minutes, distance, energy, and
            effort) so FitFight can prepare later challenge types. Those extra readings
            are not used to score today&apos;s Steps fights and are not shown to other people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants in the same private Fight can see each other&apos;s username,
            aggregate Steps total for the Fight, relevant daily Steps totals shown in the
            Fight chart, rank, Fight title, Fight action, and duration. They never receive another
            participant&apos;s raw Apple Health samples or unrelated Health history.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>How we use data</h2>
          <p>We use the data above to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>create and secure your account;</li>
            <li>create, invite participants to, score, and finish private Fights;</li>
            <li>show standings and shared Fight history;</li>
            <li>share posts with your chosen audience and moderate reports and blocks;</li>
            <li>send optional challenge and social notifications;</li>
            <li>run the in-app bugs and feature-request board;</li>
            <li>answer support requests; and</li>
            <li>detect errors, abuse, and security problems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            FitFight does not sell personal data, show advertising, or use account or
            Health data for advertising, cross-app tracking, or data brokerage.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Who processes data</h2>
          <p>
            FitFight uses Supabase for authentication, database, and media storage, and Vercel
            to host server APIs and scheduled processing. These providers process data
            for FitFight under their service and security terms. We do not make private
            Fight or Health data public.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apple delivers push notifications. PostHog processes crash reports linked
            to your FitFight account, with app and device details, to diagnose failures.
            Feedback can be copied to Notion for triage; an administrator can send a
            feedback report, its comments, attachments, and diagnostics to a Cursor
            cloud agent to investigate a fix. Avoid putting sensitive information in
            feedback that you do not want processed for support.
          </p>
          <p>
            When enabled on the server, OpenRouter and its model provider generate
            short challenge reminders from a limited context: whether you are ahead,
            behind, or tied, participant count, days remaining, sync status, and language.
            That request contains no account identifier, name, exact step count, Fight
            title, or raw Health reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also disclose information when required by law, to protect users or
            the service, or as part of a business transfer subject to appropriate safeguards.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Permissions, revocation, and retention</h2>
          <p>
            You can disable notifications in iOS Settings or adjust their categories
            in FitFight Settings. You choose whether to grant Apple Health access. You can remove FitFight&apos;s
            access at any time in Apple Health or iOS Settings. Revoking access stops
            future reads but does not change data already used to score a Fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            We keep account, Fight, posts, media, feedback, and uploaded Health summaries while
            your account exists.
            Support emails are kept only as long as needed to answer the request. Limited
            security and request logs follow Supabase&apos;s and Vercel&apos;s configured retention
            periods. Deleted data may remain temporarily in routine backups until those
            backups expire, or longer when required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We keep at most the 100 most recent sync timing reports for your account.
            Reports older than seven days are removed the next time your app sends a
            diagnostic report. Deleting your account removes its timing history.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Account deletion</h2>
          <p>
            You can permanently delete your account under <strong>You → Settings → Delete
            account</strong>. You do not need to contact support. Deletion removes your
            profile and username, uploaded Apple Health Fight, daily, and activity totals, legacy
            friendships, invitations, Fight memberships, scores, posts and media,
            notification registrations, bugs and feature requests
            you posted, and every Fight you
            created. It also removes your participation from Fights created by someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            When FitFight has a revocable Sign in with Apple credential, it asks Apple to
            revoke that credential as part of deleting the FitFight login and signing you out.
            If automatic revocation is unavailable, the app tells you how to disconnect
            FitFight in Apple settings. Deletion does not remove information stored in
            Apple Health or delete your Apple ID.
          </p>

          <h2>Your choices</h2>
          <p>
            You may ask to access, correct, or delete information associated with your

            the address connected to your account so we can verify the request.
