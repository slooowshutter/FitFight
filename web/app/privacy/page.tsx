          FitFight lets named participants compete on who records the most Steps during
          a private Fight. This policy explains the data used by the FitFight iPhone app
          and its support website.

          <h2>Data we collect</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Account data:</strong> your Sign in with Apple identifier, email
              address (which may be an Apple private relay address), name when Apple
              supplies it, the FitFight username you choose, and an encrypted server-only
              Apple credential used to disconnect Sign in with Apple when you delete your
              account.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fight data:</strong> the usernames invited to a Fight, its action
              and duration, membership status, aggregate scores, rank, and timestamps.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Apple Health Steps:</strong> with your permission, FitFight reads
              Step Count and sends the merged total for each exact Fight window plus the
              relevant merged daily totals used by Fight charts.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Support and operations:</strong> messages you send to support and
              limited server logs such as request time, IP address, device or browser
              information, and error details needed to keep the service secure and working.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Requests board:</strong> feature requests and bugs you post, your
              votes, reports, and blocks. Posts show your username and are visible to every
              signed-in FitFight user.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Apple Health</h2>
          <p>
            Apple Health access is read-only and limited to Step Count. FitFight does not
            write to Apple Health. The current app does not send raw Health samples,
            individual workouts, routes, heart rate, or device and source metadata to
            FitFight servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Participants in the same private Fight can see each other&apos;s username,
            aggregate Steps total for the Fight, relevant daily Steps totals shown in the
            Fight chart, rank, Fight action, and duration. They never receive another
            participant&apos;s raw Apple Health samples or unrelated Health history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feature requests and bugs posted under You → Settings → Requests are visible
            to every signed-in FitFight user, including the author&apos;s username.
          </p>

          <h2>How we use data</h2>
          <p>We use the data above to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>create and secure your account;</li>
            <li>create, invite participants to, score, and finish private Fights;</li>
            <li>show standings and shared Fight history;</li>
            <li>publish and moderate the in-app feature request and bug board;</li>
            <li>answer support requests; and</li>
            <li>detect errors, abuse, and security problems.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            FitFight does not sell personal data, show advertising, or use account or
            Health data for advertising, cross-app tracking, or data brokerage.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Who processes data</h2>
          <p>
            FitFight uses Supabase for authentication and database services, and Vercel
            to host server APIs and scheduled processing. These providers process data
            for FitFight under their service and security terms. We do not make private
            Fight or Health data public.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also disclose information when required by law, to protect users or
            the service, or as part of a business transfer subject to appropriate safeguards.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Permissions, revocation, and retention</h2>
          <p>
            You choose whether to grant Apple Health access. You can remove FitFight&apos;s
            access at any time in Apple Health or iOS Settings. Revoking access stops
            future reads but does not change data already used to score a Fight.
          </p>
          <p>
            We keep account, Fight, and uploaded Steps data while your account exists.
            Support emails are kept only as long as needed to answer the request. Limited
            security and request logs follow Supabase&apos;s and Vercel&apos;s configured retention
            periods. Deleted data may remain temporarily in routine backups until those
            backups expire, or longer when required by law.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Account deletion</h2>
          <p>
            You can permanently delete your account under <strong>You → Settings → Delete
            account</strong>. You do not need to contact support. Deletion removes your
            profile and username, uploaded Apple Health Fight and daily totals, legacy
            friendships, invitations, Fight memberships, scores, feature requests and
            votes you posted, and every Fight you created. It also removes your
            participation from Fights created by someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            When FitFight has a revocable Sign in with Apple credential, it asks Apple to
            revoke that credential as part of deleting the FitFight login and signing you out.
            If automatic revocation is unavailable, the app tells you how to disconnect
            FitFight in Apple settings. Deletion does not remove information stored in
            Apple Health or delete your Apple ID.
          </p>

        <section>
          <h2>Your choices</h2>
          <p>
            You may ask to access, correct, or delete information associated with your
            account. Email <a href="mailto:marc@marclamy.com">marc@marclamy.com</a> from
            the address connected to your account so we can verify the request.
