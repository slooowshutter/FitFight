          <h2>How to install</h2>
          <p>
            FitFight is a TestFlight beta, not on the App Store yet. Use the same
            TestFlight link twice.
          </p>
          <ol className="install-steps">
            <li>
              <strong>First tap installs TestFlight.</strong> If you don&apos;t
              already have Apple&apos;s TestFlight app, the link installs TestFlight
              — not FitFight. That is expected.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tap the same link again to install FitFight.</strong> After
              TestFlight is on your iPhone, open that same link a second time. That
              second tap is what adds FitFight.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>You do not need a code.</strong> If TestFlight asks for a
              redemption code, you skipped the second tap. Close that screen and
              open the same TestFlight link again.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <a
            className="primary-action invite-download"
            href="https://testflight.apple.com/join/wcZKdwVZ"
            rel="noreferrer"
          >
            Open this TestFlight link
          </a>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Apple Health Steps</h2>
          <p>
            In FitFight, open <strong>You → Apple Health</strong> to grant read-only
            Apple Health access or retry a sync. The permission sheet may list steps plus
            other movement types. Fights still use Steps. FitFight reads aggregate Steps
            for your active Fight windows and the relevant daily totals shown in Fight
            charts; background updates depend on iOS and may not be immediate.
          </p>
          <p>
            To revoke access, remove FitFight in Apple Health or iOS Settings. Your score
            may remain incomplete after access is removed.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Bugs and feature requests</h2>
          <p>
            Open <strong>You → Settings → Bugs &amp; requests</strong> to post a bug or a
            feature request, see what other signed-in people submitted, upvote, and comment
            with your username. You can still email support for account or Health issues.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Inviting someone</h2>
          <p>
            Enter their exact FitFight username when creating a Fight. They must first
            sign in with Apple and choose a username. The invitation then appears in
            their Fights list for acceptance.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Scores and Fight timing</h2>
          <p>
            FitFight compares Apple Health&apos;s merged Step Count over the same exact
            Fight window for every participant. Open the app to refresh current Steps.
            Steps that occur after the Fight&apos;s end time do not count toward its result.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2>Delete your account</h2>
          <p>
            Open <strong>You → Settings → Delete account</strong> and confirm. This
            permanently removes your profile, uploaded Steps, invitations and memberships,
            bugs and feature requests you posted, removes you from Fights created by someone else, and deletes Fights you created
            for every participant. FitFight also asks Apple to revoke an available Sign in
            with Apple credential and signs you out. This cannot be undone.
          </p>
          <p>
            If automatic Apple revocation was unavailable, follow the message in the app to
            disconnect FitFight in iPhone Settings. If deletion itself fails, retry and email
            support from the address linked to your account.
          </p>
